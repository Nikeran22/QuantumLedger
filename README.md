# QuantumLedger: A Python Framework for Decentralized Data Integrity

QuantumLedger is a Python-based framework designed to provide a secure and auditable solution for managing and verifying data integrity in distributed environments. This project leverages cryptographic hashing and a distributed ledger approach to ensure data authenticity and prevent unauthorized modifications. QuantumLedger is ideal for applications requiring tamper-proof record-keeping, transparent data management, and secure data sharing across multiple parties. It provides a robust and scalable foundation for building trust and accountability in any data-driven ecosystem.

QuantumLedger aims to simplify the implementation of decentralized data solutions by providing a modular and extensible framework. It abstracts away the complexities of managing a distributed ledger, allowing developers to focus on the specific data management requirements of their applications. By utilizing cryptographic techniques, QuantumLedger ensures that any attempt to alter the data will be easily detectable, providing a strong deterrent against malicious activity. The framework is designed with performance in mind, allowing it to handle large volumes of data efficiently.

This framework offers a flexible and configurable architecture, enabling developers to customize the ledger's structure and behavior to suit their specific needs. QuantumLedger supports various data formats and can be easily integrated with existing systems. Its modular design allows for the addition of new features and functionalities, making it a valuable tool for building future-proof data management solutions. Whether you need to track transactions, manage supply chains, or secure sensitive information, QuantumLedger provides a solid foundation for building decentralized applications.

Key Features:

*   **Cryptographic Hashing:** Utilizes SHA-256 hashing algorithm to generate unique fingerprints of data blocks, ensuring data integrity. Each block's hash is dependent on the previous block's hash, forming a chain of linked data.
*   **Distributed Ledger:** Employs a distributed ledger model where data blocks are replicated across multiple nodes, enhancing data availability and resilience.
*   **Consensus Mechanism:** Implements a simplified Proof-of-Authority (PoA) consensus mechanism for validating and adding new blocks to the ledger. The PoA mechanism requires pre-selected validators to approve transactions and create new blocks.
*   **Data Validation:** Incorporates a data validation layer that allows for defining custom rules and constraints for data entries, ensuring data quality and consistency. This validation layer can be customized based on the applications specific data requirements.
*   **API for Data Access:** Provides a simple and intuitive API for adding, retrieving, and verifying data on the ledger. The API allows developers to interact with the ledger programmatically.
*   **Audit Trail:** Maintains a complete and immutable audit trail of all data changes, enabling transparent and verifiable data history. This feature is crucial for regulatory compliance and accountability.

Technology Stack:

*   **Python:** The primary programming language used for building the framework. Python's versatility and extensive libraries make it ideal for this project.
*   **SQLite:** Used as the default storage mechanism for the ledger. SQLite is a lightweight and embedded database that is easy to set up and use.
*   **Hashinglib:** Python's built-in hashing library used for cryptographic hashing.
*   **Flask (Optional):** A lightweight web framework that can be used to create a RESTful API for interacting with the ledger.
*   **JSON:** Used for serializing and deserializing data for storage and communication.

Installation:

1.  Clone the repository from GitHub:
    git clone https://github.com/Nikeran22/QuantumLedger.git
2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    cd QuantumLedger
3.  Create a virtual environment (recommended):
    python3 -m venv venv
4.  Activate the virtual environment:
    source venv/bin/activate  (on Linux/macOS)
    venv\Scripts\activate (on Windows)
5.  Install the required dependencies:
    pip install -r requirements.txt

Configuration:

*   **Ledger Path:** The location where the ledger database will be stored. This can be configured by setting the `LEDGER_PATH` environment variable. Default: `ledger.db`
    export LEDGER_PATH=/path/to/your/ledger.db
*   **Validator List:** The list of authorized validators for the Proof-of-Authority consensus mechanism. This can be configured by modifying the `VALIDATORS` variable in the `config.py` file.
*   **API Port (if using Flask):** The port number on which the RESTful API will be hosted. This can be configured by setting the `API_PORT` environment variable. Default: `5000`
    export API_PORT=8080

Usage:

Adding a data block:
python
from quantumledger import QuantumLedger
ledger = QuantumLedger()
data = {"key": "value"}
block_hash = ledger.add_block(data)
print(f"Block Hash: {block_hash}")

Retrieving a data block:
python
block = ledger.get_block(block_hash)
print(f"Block Data: {block}")

Verifying the ledger integrity:
python
is_valid = ledger.is_ledger_valid()
print(f"Ledger Valid: {is_valid}")

Detailed API documentation (if Flask is used to create a RESTful API):
*   `POST /blocks`: Adds a new block to the ledger. Request body should be a JSON object containing the data to be added. Returns the hash of the new block.
*   `GET /blocks/{hash}`: Retrieves a block from the ledger based on its hash. Returns the block data as a JSON object.
*   `GET /validate`: Validates the integrity of the ledger. Returns a boolean indicating whether the ledger is valid.
